/*
Reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort for more detail about how this sorting algorithm works.

Sort an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.

First divide the list into its smallest unit (arrays with a single item in them)

Then compare each element with the adjacent list and combine them in the proper order.

Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

Example: 

- Input: [1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7]

- Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7];

[1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

[1, 6, 3][2, 4, 7]

[1][6, 3][2][4, 7]

[1][6][3][2][4][7]

[1, 3][6][2][4][7]

[1, 3][6][2, 4][7]

[1, 3, 6][2, 4][7]

[1, 3, 6][2, 4, 7]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
